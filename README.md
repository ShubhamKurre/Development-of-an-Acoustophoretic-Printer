# 🔊 Development of an Acoustophoretic Printer

This project focuses on the **design and development of an acoustophoretic droplet-printing system**, integrating a **subwavelength acoustic resonator** with a **CNC 3018 motion platform**.  
The printer enables **contactless, viscosity-agnostic droplet ejection** for applications in **bioprinting, functional inks, and lab-on-chip systems**.


---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a **subwavelength acoustic resonator** capable of generating focused acoustic radiation pressure for droplet ejection.
- Integrate the resonator with a **3-axis CNC platform** for controlled spatial positioning.
- Characterize droplet formation across **varied viscosities (1–500 mPa·s)** and correlate results with theoretical models.
- Demonstrate **non-contact, controllable droplet deposition** for multi-material printing.

## 🧠 Background

**Acoustophoretic printing** uses sound waves instead of mechanical nozzles to eject droplets.  
By generating a standing acoustic wave inside a resonator, localized pressure nodes form — capable of **propelling droplets** from a liquid meniscus without physical contact.  

This eliminates issues like **nozzle clogging**, **shear damage to biofluids**, and **material dependency**, making it ideal for:
- **Bioprinting (cell-laden gels, proteins)**
- **Functional inks and polymers**
- **Microfluidic and lab-on-chip patterning**

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Acoustic Resonator Design
- Designed **subwavelength cavity (λ/2)** geometry using COMSOL and analytical equations.  
- Optimized for **40 kHz resonance** to produce uniform standing wave pattern.  
- Verified **acoustic pressure distribution** via simulation.

### 2. Integration with CNC Platform
- Mounted transducer and liquid reservoir onto the CNC’s Z-axis carriage.
- Used **GRBL G-code control** for spatial droplet deposition.
- Achieved **stepwise motion of 0.1 mm** for accurate pattern formation.

### 3. Droplet Formation & Characterization
- Conducted droplet ejection experiments under quasi-static conditions.
- Recorded droplet size and velocity using high-speed imaging.
- Observed **80–120 μm droplet diameter**, consistent with theoretical predictions:
  
  \[
  F_{ac} = \frac{2 \pi P_0^2}{\rho c^2 \lambda}
  \]

### 4. Theoretical Validation
- Compared experimental droplet size with acoustic pressure-based ejection models.
- Validated performance for **viscosity range 1–500 mPa·s** (water to glycerol).
